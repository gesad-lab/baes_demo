🧠 BAE System - Conversational Interface
============================================================
🎯 Proof of Concept: Scenario 1 - Initial System Generation
💬 I'm your Business Autonomous Entity assistant!
📚 I generate academic management systems for you.
🌐 CRUD operations available in generated web UI!
🔄 Auto-restart: New entities appear immediately in web UI

ℹ️  Commands: 'help', 'examples', 'status', 'files', 'quit'

🚀 Let's start! What kind of system would you like me to generate?
💡 Try: 'Create a student management system' or 'add student'

🤔 Request Clarification Needed
==================================================
Original request: 'add email to student entity'

🤖 System Interpretation:
   Operation type: unknown
   Confidence: 0.9/1.0
   Reasoning: The request 'add email to student entity' matches the pattern for adding a field to an existing entity. The Student entity exists with attributes id and name, and the request specifies adding a new attribute 'email'.

💭 Your request could mean:
   1) Execute as interpreted (unknown)
   2) Create a relationship between entities (add foreign key)
   3) Add a field/attribute to existing entity
   4) Create a new entity in the system
   c) Cancel this request

🎯 Please select (1-4, c): 3
🔄 Using clarified request: 'add field to existing entity: add email to student entity'
✅ Servers already running - reusing existing instances
