## 🔬 Scenario 1: Initial System Generation

**Objective:** Demonstrate automatic creation of functional system from natural language through domain entity autonomy.

**Input:** HBE request: *"Create a system to manage students with name, registration number, and course"*

**Student BAE Process:**
1. **🧠 Interpret** business request using domain knowledge
2. **📋 Extract** domain attributes and business vocabulary
3. **🎯 Create** SWEA coordination plan maintaining semantic coherence
4. **📚 Preserve** domain knowledge for reusability
5. **✅ Validate** coordination plan completeness

**Expected SWEA Coordination:**
- Step 1: StudentBAE generates domain entity schema
- Step 2: ProgrammerSWEA creates FastAPI backend
- Step 3: DatabaseSWEA creates persistence layer
- Step 4: FrontendSWEA generates Streamlit UI

**Success Criteria:**
- ⏱️ Generation time < 3 minutes
- ✅ 100% functional system
- 🎯 Domain entity autonomy maintained
- 📚 Semantic coherence preserved

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
HBE (Human Business Expert)
    ↓ (natural language with business vocabulary)
Student BAE (Domain Entity Representative)
    ↓ (domain interpretation & SWEA coordination)
Context Store (Domain Knowledge Preservation)
    ↓ (coordination plan)
SWEA Agents (ProgrammerSWEA, FrontendSWEA, DatabaseSWEA)
    ↓ (generated artifacts with semantic coherence)
Functional System (API + UI + Database)
```

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Python 3.11+** - Core implementation language
- **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini** - Domain entity reasoning and code generation
- **FastAPI** - Backend framework (to be generated by SWEA)
- **Streamlit** - Frontend framework (to be generated by SWEA)
- **SQLite** - Database (to be generated by SWEA)
- **Pydantic** - Domain entity validation
- **LangGraph** - Agent orchestration (planned)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Setup Environment

```bash
cd bae_academic_system
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure OpenAI API Key

Create a `.env` file or update `config.py`:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

### 3. Run Core Tests

```bash
python test_scenario1.py
```

Expected output: **5/5 tests passed** ✅

### 4. Test Student BAE Independently

```python
from agents.student_bae import StudentBAE

# Initialize Student BAE
student_bae = StudentBAE()

# Test business request interpretation
result = student_bae.handle_task("interpret_business_request", {
    "request": "Create a system to manage students with name, registration number, and course",
    "context": "academic"
})

print(result)
```

## 🤝 Domain Entity Focus

This implementation emphasizes the **innovative BAE approach** where:

1. **Student BAE** represents the domain entity as a living, autonomous agent
2. **Business vocabulary** is preserved throughout all technical artifacts
3. **Semantic coherence** is maintained between domain concepts and code
4. **Domain knowledge** is preserved for cross-organizational reusability
5. **SWEA agents** are coordinated by BAEs, not operating independently

This differs from traditional LMA approaches by focusing on **domain entity autonomy** rather than software engineering role simulation.
