# 📚 BAE Proof of Concept Documentation

## Business Autonomous Entities - Adaptive Academic System

This documentation contains all the artifacts needed to implement and validate the BAE architecture proof of concept proposed in the doctoral thesis "Agentes Baseados em LLM como Entidades Autônomas de Negócio: Uma Nova Arquitetura para Construção Adaptativa de Sistemas de Informação".

The core innovation demonstrated is the concept of Business Autonomous Entities (BAEs) as living domain entity representatives that maintain semantic coherence between business vocabulary and technical artifacts, enabling runtime evolution and cross-organizational reusability.

### **Technology Stack**
- **Python 3.11+** + **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini** (for domain entity reasoning)
- **FastAPI** (API) + **Streamlit** (UI) + **SQLite** (DB)
- **LangGraph** (orchestration) + **Pydantic** (validation with domain focus)

### **Key Innovation**
Unlike traditional LMA systems that simulate software engineering roles, this architecture centers on Business Autonomous Entities (BAEs) that represent domain entities as autonomous agents responsible for semantic modeling, persistence, interface generation, and coordination with auxiliary SWEA agents.
