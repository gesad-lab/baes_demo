## 🎨 **Natural Language Refinement**

### **Description**
Ability to iteratively improve generated artifacts through conversational feedback, allowing fine-tuning of UI, API, and business logic without regenerating the entire system.

### **Example Workflow**
```
HBE: "Create a student registration form"
🧠 BAE: [Generates basic form with name, email, age]

HBE: "Make the form more user-friendly"
🧠 BAE: [Adds input validation, better labels, help text, progress indicators]

HBE: "The email validation is too strict"
🧠 BAE: [Adjusts email regex to be more permissive]

HBE: "Add a progress indicator"
🧠 BAE: [Implements multi-step form with progress bar]

HBE: "Change the color scheme to blue"
🧠 BAE: [Updates Streamlit theme and CSS styling]
```

### **Technical Implementation**
- **Incremental Code Updates**: Modify specific sections without full regeneration
- **Style Management**: CSS/Theme customization through natural language
- **Validation Tuning**: Business rule adjustment via conversation

## 📋 **Design Principles for Future Features**

### **Semantic Coherence**
All features must maintain alignment between business vocabulary and technical implementation.

### **BAE Autonomy**
Features should enhance, not replace, the autonomous decision-making capabilities of Business Autonomous Entities.

### **Domain Focus**
Every feature must serve the goal of better domain entity representation and business value delivery.

### **Progressive Enhancement**
Features should build upon existing BAE capabilities without breaking backward compatibility.

### **Natural Language First**
All features should be accessible through conversational interfaces, maintaining the HBE interaction paradigm.
