## üéØ **KEY VALIDATION POINTS**

### ‚úÖ Milestone 1 (End of Week 1)
- **Basic agent communication works**
- **StudentBAE generates valid Pydantic models**
- **OpenAI integration is stable**

### ‚úÖ Milestone 2 (End of Week 2)  
- **Complete system generation works (API + UI + DB)**
- **Runtime workflow execution functions**
- **Dynamic file generation is operational**

### ‚úÖ Milestone 3 (End of Week 3)
- **System can evolve at runtime**
- **Docker deployment is successful**
- **Demo scenarios work end-to-end**

---

## üß™ **VALIDATION SCENARIOS (PROOF OF CONCEPT)**

### Scenario 1: Initial System Generation
```bash
# HBE input: "Create a system to manage students with name, registration number, and course"
# Expected: Complete web system (API + UI + DB) operational in < 3 minutes
# Validation: 100% functional system without manual intervention
```

### Scenario 2: Runtime Evolution
```bash
# HBE input: "Add birth date and grade point average fields to student"
# Expected: System evolves dynamically in < 2 minutes without data loss
# Validation: Zero downtime, data preserved, new functionality available
```

### Scenario 3: Reusability and Configuration
```bash
# HBE input: "Student should have modality field (in-person/online) and doesn't need formal registration"
# Expected: BAE adapts to new context in < 1 minute with >80% reuse
# Validation: Functional system for open courses with minimal recoding
```

## üö® **TROUBLESHOOTING CHECKLIST**

### Common Issues & Solutions

**OpenAI API Issues:**
- [ ] Verify API key is valid and has credits
- [ ] Check rate limits and retry logic
- [ ] Test with different models (gpt-4o-mini vs gpt-4)

**Code Generation Issues:**
- [ ] Validate prompt templates are correctly formatted
- [ ] Check generated code syntax before execution
- [ ] Implement fallback/retry mechanisms

**Dynamic Loading Issues:**
- [ ] Ensure proper Python path management
- [ ] Validate generated file permissions
- [ ] Check for import conflicts

**Docker Issues:**
- [ ] Verify port mappings (8000, 8501)
- [ ] Check environment variable passing
- [ ] Validate volume mounts for generated files
