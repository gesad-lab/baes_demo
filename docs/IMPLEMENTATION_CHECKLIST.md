## üéØ **KEY VALIDATION POINTS**

### ‚úÖ Milestone 1 (End of Week 1)
- **Basic BAE-SWEA communication works with domain entity focus**
- **StudentBAE generates valid Pydantic models with semantic coherence**
- **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini integration is stable and properly configured**

### ‚úÖ Milestone 2 (End of Week 2)
- **Complete system generation works (API + UI + DB) under BAE coordination**
- **Runtime workflow execution functions with domain entity autonomy**
- **Dynamic file generation is operational with semantic alignment**

### ‚úÖ Milestone 3 (End of Week 3)

## üß™ **VALIDATION SCENARIOS (PROOF OF CONCEPT)**

### Scenario 1: Initial System Generation
```bash
# HBE input: "Create a system to manage students with name, registration number, and course"
# Expected: Complete web system (API + UI + DB) operational in < 3 minutes
# Validation: 100% functional system without manual intervention
```

### Scenario 2: Runtime Evolution
```bash
# HBE input: "Add birth date and grade point average fields to student"
# Expected: System evolves dynamically in < 2 minutes without data loss
# Validation: Zero downtime, data preserved, new functionality available
```

### Scenario 3: Reusability and Configuration
```bash
# HBE input: "Student should have modality field (in-person/online) and doesn't need formal registration"
# Expected: BAE adapts to new context in < 1 minute with >80% reuse
# Validation: Functional system for open courses with minimal recoding
```
