# 📋 PROOF OF CONCEPT - BAE Architecture

## Business Autonomous Entities: Adaptive Academic System

---

## 🎯 GENERAL OBJECTIVE

Validate the viability of the proposed architecture through the implementation of a Business Autonomous Entity (BAE) responsible for the "Student" entity in a simulated academic system, demonstrating that BAEs can operate autonomously in system generation and evolution, maintaining semantic coherence between the business domain and the produced technical artifacts. This proof of concept validates the core thesis proposition that BAEs represent domain entities as living, autonomous agents within the system, capable of runtime evolution and semantic reusability.

## 🧪 VALIDATION SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: Initial System Generation
**Objective:** Demonstrate the capability of automatic creation of a functional system from natural language, where the Student BAE acts as an autonomous domain entity representative.

**Input:** HBE provides request: *"Create a system to manage students with name, registration number, and course"*

**Expected Process:**
1. **Student BAE** (as domain entity representative) interprets the natural language demand
2. Defines semantic structure of the entity with attributes: name (string), registration (string), course (string)
3. **SWEA Orchestration coordinated by Student BAE:**
   - **SWEA Programmer:** Generates Pydantic entity model maintaining domain coherence
   - **SWEA Programmer:** Creates REST API with CRUD operations (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE)
   - **SWEA Database:** Generates SQLite schema with 'students' table
   - **SWEA Frontend:** Develops Streamlit interface for data manipulation

**Expected Result:**
- Operational web system accessible via browser
- API documented with Swagger/OpenAPI
- Functional database with persistence
- Intuitive interface for student CRUD operations
- Semantic coherence between business vocabulary and technical artifacts

**Success Criteria:**
- Generation time < 3 minutes
- 100% functional system without manual intervention
- Generated code follows programming best practices
- Maintains domain entity focus throughout generated artifacts

### Scenario 2: Runtime Evolution
**Objective:** Validate the adaptive capacity of the architecture without system reinitialization, demonstrating BAEs as living domain entities.

**Input:** HBE requests: *"Add birth date and grade point average fields to student"*

**Expected Process:**
1. **Student BAE** recognizes existing model evolution request
2. Updates internal representation: adds birth_date (date) and grade_point_average (float)
3. **SWEA Coordination for migration orchestrated by Student BAE:**
   - **SWEA Database:** Executes ALTER TABLE preserving existing data
   - **SWEA Programmer:** Regenerates Pydantic model with new fields
   - **SWEA Programmer:** Updates API endpoints to include new attributes
   - **SWEA Frontend:** Modifies interface dynamically with new input fields

**Expected Result:**
- System continues operational during evolution
- Previously inserted data is preserved
- New functionality immediately available
- Referential integrity maintained
- Semantic coherence preserved between domain vocabulary and technical implementation

**Success Criteria:**
- Migration without data loss
- Evolution time < 2 minutes
- Zero system downtime
- Maintained domain entity autonomy throughout evolution

---

### Scenario 3: Reusability and Configuration
**Objective:** Demonstrate the reuse potential of BAEs in different contexts, validating the concept of domain entity knowledge preservation and adaptation.

**Input:** Instantiation of Student BAE for open courses system: *"Student should have modality field (in-person/online) and doesn't need formal registration"*

**Expected Process:**
1. **Student BAE** receives contextual configuration
2. Adapts base model removing 'registration' field and adding 'modality' (enum)
3. Reuses existing business logic and domain knowledge
4. Applies specific configurations for the new domain while preserving core entity understanding

**Expected Result:**
- New system generated rapidly based on existing BAE domain knowledge
- Functionalities adapted to specific context
- Minimal recoding necessary
- Domain entity understanding preserved across contexts

**Success Criteria:**
- >80% reuse of code/logic from original BAE
- Configuration in < 1 minute
- Functional system for new context
- Semantic coherence maintained across different organizational contexts
