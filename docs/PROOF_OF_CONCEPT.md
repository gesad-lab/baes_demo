# üìã PROOF OF CONCEPT - BAE Architecture

## Business Autonomous Entities: Adaptive Academic System

---

## üéØ GENERAL OBJECTIVE

Validate the viability of the proposed architecture through the implementation of a Business Autonomous Entity (BAE) responsible for the "Student" entity in a simulated academic system, demonstrating that BAEs can operate autonomously in system generation and evolution, maintaining semantic coherence between the business domain and the produced technical artifacts.

## üß™ VALIDATION SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: Initial System Generation
**Objective:** Demonstrate the capability of automatic creation of a functional system from natural language.

**Input:** HBE provides request: *"Create a system to manage students with name, registration number, and course"*

**Expected Process:**
1. **"Student" BAE** interprets the natural language demand
2. Defines semantic structure of the entity with attributes: name (string), registration (string), course (string)
3. **SWEA Orchestration:**
   - **SWEA Programmer:** Generates Pydantic entity model
   - **SWEA Programmer:** Creates REST API with CRUD operations (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE)
   - **SWEA Database:** Generates SQLite schema with 'students' table
   - **SWEA Frontend:** Develops Streamlit interface for data manipulation

**Expected Result:**
- Operational web system accessible via browser
- API documented with Swagger/OpenAPI
- Functional database with persistence
- Intuitive interface for student CRUD operations

**Success Criteria:**
- Generation time < 3 minutes
- 100% functional system without manual intervention
- Generated code follows programming best practices

---

### Scenario 2: Runtime Evolution
**Objective:** Validate the adaptive capacity of the architecture without system reinitialization.

**Input:** HBE requests: *"Add birth date and grade point average fields to student"*

**Expected Process:**
1. **"Student" BAE** recognizes existing model evolution
2. Updates internal representation: adds birth_date (date) and grade_point_average (float)
3. **SWEA Coordination for migration:**
   - **SWEA Database:** Executes ALTER TABLE preserving existing data
   - **SWEA Programmer:** Regenerates Pydantic model with new fields
   - **SWEA Programmer:** Updates API endpoints to include new attributes
   - **SWEA Frontend:** Modifies interface dynamically with new input fields

**Expected Result:**
- System continues operational during evolution
- Previously inserted data is preserved
- New functionality immediately available
- Referential integrity maintained

**Success Criteria:**
- Migration without data loss
- Evolution time < 2 minutes
- Zero system downtime

---

### Scenario 3: Reusability and Configuration
**Objective:** Demonstrate the reuse potential of BAEs in different contexts.

**Input:** Instantiation of "Student" BAE for open courses system: *"Student should have modality field (in-person/online) and doesn't need formal registration"*

**Expected Process:**
1. **"Student" BAE** receives contextual configuration
2. Adapts base model removing 'registration' field and adding 'modality' (enum)
3. Reuses existing business logic
4. Applies specific configurations for the new domain

**Expected Result:**
- New system generated rapidly based on existing BAE
- Functionalities adapted to specific context
- Minimal recoding necessary

**Success Criteria:**
- >80% reuse of code/logic from original BAE
- Configuration in < 1 minute
- Functional system for new context
