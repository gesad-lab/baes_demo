# BAE System Changelog

## 2024-06-14 - Enhanced Server Management & Auto-Restart

### 🚀 **NEW: Automatic Server Restart After Entity Changes**

**Feature**: Auto-restart servers when new entities are added to immediately update the web UI.

**Problem Solved**: Previously, when adding new entities (like courses or teachers) to an existing system, the web UI wouldn't show the new entities until servers were manually restarted. This interrupted the PoC demonstration flow.

**Solution**:
- **Smart Auto-Restart**: Automatically restarts servers when new entity models are generated while servers are already running
- **Entity Detection**: Only triggers restart when actual new entities are added (not for regular updates)
- **Configurable**: Toggle ON/OFF with `toggle auto restart` command (default: ON)
- **Clear Feedback**: User-friendly messages explaining what's happening and why

**Benefits for PoC**:
- ✅ **Seamless Entity Addition**: New entities appear immediately in web UI
- ✅ **Better Demo Flow**: No manual intervention needed during demonstrations
- ✅ **User-Friendly**: Clear feedback about auto-restart actions
- ✅ **Configurable**: Can be disabled if manual control is preferred

**New CLI Commands**:
- `toggle auto restart` - Enable/disable automatic server restart after entity changes
- Enhanced `help` command shows current auto-restart status

### 🔧 **IMPROVED: Server Management Commands**

## 2024-06-14 - Server Management Fix

### 🔧 **Fixed: "restart servers" Command Issue**

**Problem**: The `restart servers` command was incorrectly routing through the natural language processing system, causing it to fail with "unknown entity" errors.

**Root Cause**: The CLI was calling `kernel.process_natural_language_request("refresh system")` which triggered entity recognition on a non-entity command.

**Solution**:
- Modified `_restart_servers()` method to call server management functions directly
- Added proper managed system validation before restart attempts
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Added new `start servers` command for non-disruptive server startup

**Files Changed**:
- `bae_chat.py`: Updated `_restart_servers()` method and added `_start_servers_only()`

**New Commands**:
- `restart servers` - Kill existing servers and start fresh instances
- `start servers` - Start servers without killing existing ones (safer option)

### ✅ **Benefits**
- ✅ Server restart now works reliably without OpenAI API calls
- ✅ Better error messages and user guidance
- ✅ Improved server status checking and feedback
- ✅ Separate start option for safer server management

### 🧪 **Testing**
- Validated with unit test confirming no natural language processing calls
- Tested both restart and start server scenarios
- Confirmed proper error handling for missing managed systems
