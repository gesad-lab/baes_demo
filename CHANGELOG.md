# BAE System Changelog

## 2024-06-14 - Server Management Fix

### 🔧 **Fixed: "restart servers" Command Issue**

**Problem**: The `restart servers` command was incorrectly routing through the natural language processing system, causing it to fail with "unknown entity" errors.

**Root Cause**: The CLI was calling `kernel.process_natural_language_request("refresh system")` which triggered entity recognition on a non-entity command.

**Solution**:
- Modified `_restart_servers()` method to call server management functions directly
- Added proper managed system validation before restart attempts
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Added new `start servers` command for non-disruptive server startup

**Files Changed**:
- `bae_chat.py`: Updated `_restart_servers()` method and added `_start_servers_only()`

**New Commands**:
- `restart servers` - Kill existing servers and start fresh instances
- `start servers` - Start servers without killing existing ones (safer option)

### ✅ **Benefits**
- ✅ Server restart now works reliably without OpenAI API calls
- ✅ Better error messages and user guidance
- ✅ Improved server status checking and feedback
- ✅ Separate start option for safer server management

### 🧪 **Testing**
- Validated with unit test confirming no natural language processing calls
- Tested both restart and start server scenarios
- Confirmed proper error handling for missing managed systems
